# Juice_Box

What is this ingenious masterpiece you might ask.
This is the datapack I made for Twitch streamer [Juicesoar](https://twitch.tv/juicesoar).

It adds craftable bells, nametags, blackstone and smooth blackstone.

It also adds several other recipes:
- rotten flesh can be smoked into leather
- stone stairs can be smelted into stone brick stairs (w.i.p.)

Lastly it adds a drop chance for mob heads from their mobs.
